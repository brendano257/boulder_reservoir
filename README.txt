Data in reservoir_CRFs.txt, NMHC_PA.LOG, and \log do not represent real data from the ongoing project at the Boulder Reservoir, 
but were created for the purposes of this code demonstration.

The current project, developed by myself for the Atmospheric Research Lab at INSTAAR, CU: Boulder has a MatLab backend, and the ongoing data posting can be viewed here: http://instaar.colorado.edu/arl/boulder_reservoir.html

This is a Python re-working I developed as a way to teach myself several packages and continue learning Python. These processes are intended for continous running on a remote server or as a website backend that recieves regular file transfers of logged parameter values and signal data from PeakSimple from several instruments housed at the Boulder Reservoir. A more complete description of this project an its purposes can be found at the above link.
